# Math 

Currently serves only two purposes. To calculate the missing side of a triangle, angles 
and solves a right triangle if only one side and one angle are known


# Features
- Solve right triangles (Pythagorean theorem + angles)
  - It asks you to place the sides of your triangle and uses OOP to filter your input.
- Solve all angles and sides of a triangle with just one side and one angle.
- Let's you choose between radians and degrees on angles input


# Installation / How to run
1. Go to the master branch
2. Download the zip file or only the math.py file.
2. Unzip the file or open math.py
3. Then the pythagorean theorem starts automatically.



# Feedback!
If you try this out, please leave feedback on how it worked and what could be enhanced, THANKS!
